                <p>
                    As stated previously, currently a full time student on the way to becoming a competent full stack
                    developer. Outside of the classroom, most of my time is spent refining my skills in software
                    development, and if I’m not doing that, then I’m either playing some MTG with some friends at a
                    buddy’s house or working, currently as a “host” at a small Japanese restaurant in my hometown.

                <p>
                    My first job I ever got was that of a bus-boy at a Japanese restaurant. Where, within
                    less
                    than a year, I became a full time sushi chef working sixty hours a week while still attending
                    high-school.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My second job was that of a construction worker for a roofing company. This employment
                    ended
                    relatively quick due to physical injuries sustained prior to employment. (I thought I
                    could
                    handle it, my body said otherwise)
                </p>
                <p>
                    My third and most recent job is yet again at another restaurant as a bus-boy, although
                    this
                    time I made it into the kitchen, as a griller, in less than six months.
