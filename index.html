                        Customer Service: Majority of work experience comes from the resturaunt industry, starting
                        as a bus boy, until moving up to some type of cook in every establishment, one of which I
                        become a sushi chef.

                <!-- <p>
                    My first job I ever got was that of a bus-boy at a Japanese restaurant. Where, within
                    less
                    than a year, I became a full time sushi chef working sixty hours a week while still attending
                    high-school.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My second job was that of a construction worker for a roofing company. This employment
                    ended
                    relatively quick due to physical injuries sustained prior to employment. (I thought I
                    could
                    handle it, my body said otherwise)
                </p>
                <p>
                    My third and most recent job is yet again at another restaurant as a bus-boy, although
                    this
                    time I made it into the kitchen, as a griller, in less than six months.
