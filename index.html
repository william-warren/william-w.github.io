                    Experience

                <p>
                    My first job I ever got was that of a bus-boy at a Japanese restaurant. Where, within
                    less
                    than a year, I became a sushi chef.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My second job was that of a construction worker for a roofing company. This employment
                    ended
                    relatively quick due to physical injuries sustained prior to employment. (I thought I
                    could
                    handle it, my body said otherwise)
                </p>
                <p>
                    My third and most recent job is yet again at another restaurant as a bus-boy, although
                    this
                    time I made it in the kitchen, as a griller, in less than six months.
